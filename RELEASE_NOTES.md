# Release Notes - MindMeld v1.0.0

## Release Date: May 9, 2025

### Overview
This release marks the completion of the authentication flow implementation and stabilization of the MindMeld application. The E2E verification process has been completed successfully with all tests passing.

### Key Features
- Full JWT authentication with refresh token functionality
- Secure HTTP-only cookie-based token storage
- Protected routes via Next.js middleware
- Dashboard with data fetching and auto-refresh capability
- Improved error handling and loading states

### Technical Improvements
1. **Authentication System**:
   - Implemented secure JWT token generation and verification
   - Added refresh token mechanism to handle token expiration
   - Created middleware to protect routes based on authentication status
   - Added session validation before sensitive operations

2. **Data Services**:
   - Fixed API path resolution to use correct base URL
   - Provided both class-based and function-based interfaces for data services
   - Added proper error handling for API requests
   - Implemented proper loading state management

3. **E2E Testing**:
   - Stabilized Playwright tests for authentication flow
   - Added test for token expiry and refresh mechanism
   - Verified dashboard data fetching and display

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed inconsistent import patterns in dashboard component
- Corrected API path resolution to avoid duplicate '/api' prefixes
- Fixed loading state management in dashboard refresh button
- Resolved token refresh failure handling

### Verification Results
- ✅ Login form renders and functions correctly
- ✅ Authentication with JWT works as expected
- ✅ Token refresh mechanism handles expired tokens
- ✅ Dashboard displays data from API correctly
- ✅ All E2E tests pass successfully

### Internal Changes
- Updated project board to mark Phase 6: E2E Verification as complete
- Marked authentication token security risk as Resolved
- Approved JWT + refresh token authentication decision

### Next Steps
